Setting Math Class

    - Antagonist Jacob
    - Allygonist Mr Ilian

Illian You know the drill. Pass your homework to the front. -- Yesterday we talked about the Pythagorean theorem and the unit circle.

```
Mr Illian draws a circle on the board and marks the lines of the unit circle without the values below
0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 3pi/4, 5pi/6, pi
```

Illian First, what is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference?

```
Ben's hand shoots up excitedly, Jacob scowls. Mr Illian calls on another student.
```

Jacob, to Ben
Stop looking so eager. He doesn't have a treat for you.

Ben

Guess that means you had trouble with the homework?

Jacob, to Ben

At least I don't sleep with an anime love pillow. What's her name again?

```
Ben scowls, and Jacob has a grin of satisfaction and Maria giggles behind them, it is ambiguous as to what she is laughing at. Ben raises his hand when Mr Illian finishes explaining the unit circle and filling in the missing proportions.
```

Mr Illian

Ben. `He gestures off handedly.`

Ben

  Why do we write the unit circle this way?
  With these numbers?
  It seems needlessly complicated.

Mr Illian

How would you write it?

Ben

I was looking at the circle last night and I realized something. 
`Ben crosses out the existing fractions and replaces them with equal values with the common denominator of 12 from 0 to 23`
I realized this is why we have 24 hours in a day
the globe's longitudes are divided into radians.
And it is much easier to remember.

```
Mr Illian blinks and stares at the board silently, doing calculations in his head.

Ben looks nervous.
```

Mr Illian

How have I not noticed this before?!

```
Ben grins widely and is obviously smug.

Cut to Jacob and Maria split on the screen, both scowling.
```

Lunch
```
Ben stands in line for lunch, waiting for his turn with lunch card in his hand. He appears to be standing in a group, but is not paying attention to the conversation. One of the members of the group is Jill, who frequently looks at Ben intently. 
```

Amedla

... meant by that, do you Ben?

```
Ben is looking straight past her at Maria, who is wearing tight yoga pants and has an ample butt. She is bent over, reaching for her lunch card she dropped.
```

Ben

# choices
 a. "I agree."
 b. "Dunno."
 c. "Sounds good."

```
Amelda scowls, visibly annoyed. She turns to another boy, but steals glances at Ben periodically. Finally, they get through the line. Amelda gives Ben a displeased look and walks away to find a spot away from Ben.
```

Amelda
Bye then.

Ben
Yeah, see you later.
`Ben finds his friends sitting close to the exit. The available seat faces toward the wall opposite a vending machine.`
Hey guys.

```
The group acknowledges Ben momentarily but resume their conversation about a video game. 
```

Tony
I was winding up the plasma grenade to stick it to him. He was right in front of me.
`Tony mimics throwing a grenade with an orange.`

Andrew
Yeah, I had the sniper rifle out and didn't even have time to think. Then I no-scoped the grenade right out of his hand!

Tony
`Tony drops the orange and makes an explosion gesture.` I couldn't believe it!

Ben
Choices:
-a That's awesome!
-b [remain silent]
-c [imitate laughter]

I found an interesting game last night. It is basically a cashier work sim, but you coordinate with an NPC to deal drugs with a guy just outside of the store. You have special items you ring up that correspond to things that he's selling when people ask for it. You have to try to spot somebody who is a narc for a cop trying to find you out and keep what you are doing secret from your boss.

```
Tony and Andrew exchange meaningful looks.
```

Tony
`Tony awaits expectantly for more information that doesn't come. He asks, confused`
That's -- cool -- what else happens?

Ben
That's all. That's the game.

```
Tony and Andrew exchange confused looks again. . There is a period of silence in the group as they each chew their food awkwardly. Ben looks from one to the other, but doesn't know what else to say. He stares at the wall behind his friends, a blank, white wall that appears featureless in the even light. Soon Tony and Andrew resume their conversation about the game they played together the night before.
