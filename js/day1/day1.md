Each day is separated into 3 periods. 

## Math Class

    - Antagonist: Jacob
    - Allygonist: Mr Ilian

Illian: You know the drill. Pass your homework to the front. -- Yesterday we talked about the Pythagorean theorem and the unit circle.

```
Mr Illian draws a circle on the board and marks the lines of the unit circle. 

0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 3pi/4, 5pi/6, pi
```

Illian: First, what is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference?

```
Ben's hand shoots up excitedly, Jacob scowls. Mr Illian calls on another student.
```

|Jacob, to Ben:|
:---
|Stop looking so eager. He doesn't have a treat for you.|

|Ben:|
---:
|Guess that means you had trouble with the homework?|

|Jacob, to Ben:|
:---
|At least I don't sleep with an anime love pillow. What's her name again?|

```
Ben scowls, and Jacob has a grin of satisfaction and Maria giggles behind them, it is ambiguous as to what she is laughing at. Ben raises his hand when Mr Illian finishes explaining the unit circle and filling in the missing proportions.
```

|Mr Illian|
---
Ben. `He gestures off handedly.`

|Ben|
---:
|  Why do we write the unit circle this way?
  With these numbers?
  It seems needlessly complicated.|

|Mr Illian|
---
|How would you write it?|

|Ben|
---:
I was looking at the circle last night and I realized something. 
`Ben crosses out the existing fractions and replaces them with equal values with the common denominator of 12 from 0 to 23`
I realized this is why we have 24 hours in a day
the globe's longitudes are divided into radians.
And it is much easier to remember.

```
Mr Illian blinks and stares at the board silently, doing calculations in his head.

Ben looks nervous.
```

|Mr Illian|
---
|How have I not noticed this before?!|

```
Ben grins widely and is obviously smug.

Cut to Jacob and Maria split on the screen, both scowling.
