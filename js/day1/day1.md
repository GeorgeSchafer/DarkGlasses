- Goes to school.

## Math Class

    - Antagonist: Jacob
    - Allygonist: Mr Ilian

Illian: You know the drill. Pass your homework to the front. -- Yesterday we talked about the Pythagorean theorem and the unit circle.

```
Mr Illian draws a circle on the board and marks the lines of the unit circle. 

0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 3pi/4, 5pi/6, pi
```

Illian: First, what is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circumference?

```
Thomas's hjs/day1/day1.mdand shoots up excitedly, Jacob scowls. Mr Illian calls on another student.
```

|Jacob, to Thomas:|
:---
|Stop looking so eager. He doesn't have a treat for you.|

|Thomas:|
---:
|Guess that means you had trouble with the homework? I would have been happy to let you copy my work after school if you paid up.|

|Jacob:|
:---
|At least I don't sleep with an anime love pillow. What's her name again?|

```
Thomas scowls, and Jacob has a grin of satisfaction and Maria giggles behind them, it is ambiguous as to what she is laughing at. Thomas raises his hand when Mr Illian finishes explaining the unit circle and filling in the missing proportions.
```

|Mr Illian|
:---
Thomas. `He gestures off handedly.`

|Thomas|
---:
|  Why do we write the unit circle this way?
  With these numbers?
  It seems needlessly complicated.|

|Mr. Illian|
:---
| How would you write it? |

|Thomas|
---:
I was looking at the circle last night and I realized something. 
`Thomas crosses out the existing fractions and replaces them with equal values with the common denominator of 12 from 0 to 23`
I realized this is why we have 24 hours in a day
the globe's longitudes are divided into radians.
And it is much easier to remember.

```
Mr Illian blinks and stares at the board silently, doing calculations in his head.

Thomas looks nervous.
```

|Mr Illian|
:---
|How have I not noticed this before?!|

```
Thomas grins widely and is obviously smug.
```
```
Cut to Jacob and Maria split on the screen, both scowling.
```

## Lunch

```
Thomas stands in line for lunch, waiting for his turn with lunch card in his hand. He appears to be standing in a group, but is not paying attention to the conversation. One of the members of the group is Jill, who frequently looks at Thomas intently. 
```

|Amelda|
:---
|... meant by that, do you Thomas?|

```
Thomas is looking straight past her at Maria, who is wearing tight yoga pants and has an ample butt. She is bent over, reaching for her lunch card she dropped.
```

|Thomas|
---:
# choices
 a. "I agree."
 b. "Dunno."
 c. "Sounds good."

```
Amelda scowls, visibly annoyed. She turns to another boy, but steals glances at Thomas periodically. Finally, they get through the line. Amelda gives Thomas a displeased look and walks away to find a spot away from Thomas.
```

|Amelda|
:---
|Bye then.|

|Thomas|
---:
|Yeah, see you later.
`Thomas finds his friends sitting close to the exit. The available seat faces toward the wall opposite a machine.`
Hey guys.|

```
The group acknowledges Thomas momentarily but resume their conversation about a video game. 
```

|Tony|
:---
|I was winding up the plasma grenade to stick it to him. He was right in front of me.
`Tony mimics throwing a grenade with an orange.`|

|Andrew|
---:
|Yeah, I had the sniper rifle out and didn't even have time to think. Then I no-scoped the grenade right out of his hand!|

|Tony|
:---
|`Tony drops the orange and makes an explosion gesture.` I couldn't believe it!|

|Thomas's Choices|
:---
|-a. I played an interesting game last night.
-b. [remain silent]
-c. [imitate laughter]|

|Thomas|
---:
| I found an interesting game last night. It is basically a cashier work sim, but you coordinate with an NPC to deal drugs with a guy just outside of the store. You have special items you ring up that correspond to things that he's selling when people ask for it. You have to try to spot somebody who is a narc for a cop trying to find you out and keep what you are doing secret from your boss.|

## After School

### Journal entries

Choose 1:
1. *I am tired of Jacob's shit. He has been acting like a little girl with a skinned knee since I told him he had to pay up if he wanted to copy my homework.*
1. *I don't know what to do about Jacob. We had an agreement, he broke it. Why does he think he gets to berate me?*
1. *Jacob can choke on a cock. I'm tired of him treating my like a needy little teacher's pet. It's not my fault he has the intellect of a labradoodle.*

Choose 1:
1. *Maria laughed, somehow I don't think it is for my benefit. It's hard to stay angry at her when she wears those bright pink yoga pants though. They are transparent when she bends over. She wasn't wearing panties. Hot. She only notices me when she wants something.*
1. *Why can't I stay made at Maria, even when it's Jacob making her laugh. ~~What does she like about him?~~ Who am I kidding? He is the handsome one, the star player. I know how to use a calculator.*

Choose 1:
1. *The guys don't seem  to get what is fascinating about **Storefront**, I spent last night playing. They don't seem to be able to find entertainment in anything more sophisticated than a bad action movie. I am so alone.*
1. *I tried to tell the guys about that game **Storefront**. There was nothing exploding so they didn't seem to care. How can someone not have something to say about being a friendly neighborhood criminal enterprise?*

### The rest of the day
```
At the end of the day, Thomas has to devote his time to writing a paper for world history class. Afterward he plays games on his computer alone, sending messages intermittently. He finally goes to bed at 3:11AM. We see him crawl into bed with his dakimakura pillow featuring a woman with long black hair and a tight purple suit that highlights her curves.
